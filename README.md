# Psycle: Support for Autistic Children
### Welcome to Psycle, a comprehensive support platform designed to cater to the unique needs of autistic children and provide valuable assistance to their parents. 

Psycle integrates various features, including autism testing, daily comprehension questions, focus tracking, emotional monitoring through computer vision, and supportive chatbots powered by natural language processing (NLP).

Psycle is a project dedicated to supporting autistic children and their families. The platform aims to enhance the overall well-being of autistic children by providing a range of tools and features focused on their cognitive development, emotional well-being, and support for parents.

## Features
### Autism Testing

Psycle offers a dedicated page for testing autism, utilizing a random forest classifier trained on various parameters. This testing module provides valuable insights and aids in early detection, allowing for timely intervention and support.

### Grow

The Grow page generates daily comprehension questions designed to improve a child's focus and cognitive abilities. The platform encourages consistency with a streak feature, motivating children to engage in daily cognitive exercises.

### Streak

The streak feature is designed to gamify the learning experience, encouraging children to maintain a consistent routine of daily comprehension questions. This helps in fostering a habit of regular engagement with cognitive exercises.

### Focus and Emotion Tracking

During the comprehension quiz, Psycle utilizes computer vision applications to track the frequency of a child's focus and emotional expressions. This data is valuable for understanding the child's engagement levels and emotional well-being during learning activities.

### Help Bots

Psycle incorporates two chatbots powered by NLP to provide support for autistic children and their parents. One bot serves as a companion for the child, offering assistance whenever they feel low. The other bot is dedicated to assisting parents, offering guidance and resources to help them navigate the challenges associated with raising an autistic child.
