"Few people realize the challenges of being a parent, until they become one. Now, imagine the added challenges of parenting an autistic child which is becoming more common as the number of children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) increases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States, the prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder increased from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to about 1 in 68 in 2012 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). A more recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2020) suggested that in some areas of the country, the prevalence of ASD was closer to 1 in 54 children.","","","",""
"A crucial time to support parents is after a diagnosis when parents are overwhelmed by and focusing on the challenge of “what do I do?” Many parents search online for the best therapies or ask others about best parenting practices. I am here to say that autistic children do not need a perfect parent, they need a positive and accepting one.","","","",""
"The aim of this article is to give parents a glimmer of hope, emphasizing 11 compassionate parenting strategies and focusing on the joyful moments during a crucial time when parents are focusing on the challenge of “my child is autistic, what do I do?”","","","",""
"– Parents, after receiving an autism diagnosis, experience a plethora of emotions before they accept their child’s diagnosis. Many parents move through emotions like Kubler-Ross’ (1980) stages of grief; grieving for what might have been followed by a plan of action. Having an autistic child may not fit your perspective of what your family should look like, it may feel like you have a square peg to fit into your family circle. You will mourn and that is okay. Give yourself the time and space.","Allow the feelings and emotions","– My opinion, all parents of autistic children should receive a merit badge in parenting. Raising an autistic child is like learning a foreign language – but in parenting. It is challenging and sometimes overwhelming. Parents utilize numerous resources to help their child developmentally, but they still worry they are not doing a good enough job. Your child does not need the perfect parent, they need a happy and supportive one. Raising an autistic child is difficult, but it is empowering and will make you a better person.","Realize you are good enough",""
"You will experience challenging “tantrum-in-the grocery store” moments, you will worry about the future, you will become a tireless advocate for your child. I encourage you to take one moment at a time, one step at a time, one day at a time. Each day, find joy through the unique strengths of yourself and your child. Recognizing the joyful experiences helps you have a balanced perspective. Raising an autistic child is both challenging and joyful. Joy is defined in simple measures – a day at the park, an afternoon of Pokémon, a hug, your child talking about their interests, trying a novel food, or your child’s first successful play date. I will be the first to say it is hard work raising an autistic child. I encourage you to not change the way your child views the world; embrace their neurodiversity. In learning to find the joy, you are accepting your child as autistic, leveraging their strengths and interests to help them live a fulfilling life; raising your autistic child in a way that allows them to thrive.","","","",""
