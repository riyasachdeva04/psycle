"Dr. Rebecca Shaffer at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio conducted a  to better understand emotional regulation for children with autism and emotion regulation difficulties. Past studies have shown that children (and adults) with autism have a more difficult time not only recognizing facial expressions but also displaying facial expressions to match “social expectations.” The expressions they may choose to use instead might not match what the child is actually feeling or might not express a particular feeling at all. As a result every day interactions can be difficult because not everyone will understand what these expressions or lack of expressions mean. SEL can help children understand to recognize facial expressions (for example, do they pay more attention to certain areas of the face than others) as well as develop the vocabulary to express what they are feeling.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33815651/","research study","https://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/2018-08/Visual%20Supports%20Tool%20Kit.pdf","Visual Supports Toolkit","https://betterkids.education/","Autism and Expressing Emotions","","how","","Autism and the Challenge of Big Emotions","are two emotions that children with autism have a hard time recognizing even as they grow older. SEL can help children learn more about these emotions, how to express them, and find calming strategies that work for them. Encouraging emotional development should occur naturally in everyday interactions whether it be at home or school. Parents and teachers can acknowledge emotions as they occur. For example, in a classroom the teacher can point out when everyone is smiling as a result of feeling happy. Parents can also mirror positive emotions so their child can see not only the expression for themselves but also gain an understanding of empathy. Some research has shown the positive effects of using visual supports to guide emotional development. This is because  than they do by just listening. By using visual supports parents can communicate better with their children about their emotions. Autism Speaks provides a   to help teach social skills and understand expectations.

For children with autism that respond well to a visual schedule they may also respond well to the “first, then” structure of helping the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Anger.

She explained that back then, she had the most difficult time at school when she felt scared because the facial expression she displayed for fear was that of boredom. Sometimes, when her teacher was losing patience with her class, she would give strict directions to everyone. That student would automatically display her ""bored"" face, entailing the teacher to raise her voice even more. But in fact, she was scared and no one knew. It took her years to learn how to read other people's facial expressions. She also had to practice adjusting her own facial expressions (with a mirror) so they could be properly read and interpreted by others. Today, she says she still struggles with fear because for anyone who is feeling scared, it’s really hard to stop and think ""Oh wait. Let me adjust my facial expression so others will understand that I'm scared.” When she discovered  at age 18, her eyes opened wide and she exclaimed, ""Oh my God, this would have helped me so much. It would have saved me so much time and effort in trying to figure out facial expressions and communicating my emotions.”","Wisdom","Addressing social emotional learning with children with special needs will take more time and will look differently than it does with other children.
