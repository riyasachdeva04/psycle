,A PARENT’S GUIDE TO AUTISM
Frequently Asked Questions ,
from Parents,
Q: My daughter is 2 years old and was recently diagnosed with autism. I have,
some family members who keep insisting she’s just delayed. Can you give me any,
suggestions for how to respond to them?,
"Your situation is very common in families of children diagnosed with special needs, most",
especially autism. There are so many emotional processes that are occurring for the family,
as a unit and for each family member individually after getting this diagnosis. Of course there,
"is the initial shock that can send you spiraling into a true grieving process, and each of you in",
the family will work through this in your own time frame. Part of that process includes a stage,
of denial as particularly seen from family members who aren’t living with your child day-to-,
day. It’s probable that it will take them longer to come to terms with the diagnosis. In addition,
"to everything else you are doing, you must also remain patient for this to happen. Family",
members who love your child will benefit most from learning about autism so they can adapt,
their interactions and expectations to more appropriate levels.,
There are also professionals and effective support groups in your community who have a lot,
of experience and expertise in understanding this process. They may be able to provide you,
and your extended family with assistance.,
Q: My husband refuses to accept the diagnosis and will not attend appointments with,
our doctor. What can I do?,
"This is not uncommon, where one parent accepts the diagnosis and the other is in denial.",
Denial happens both to fathers and mothers. As difficult as it may be for you at a time like,
"this, you must be patient and supportive. Your spouse will eventually work through his or her",
"denial. Meanwhile, you might try to recommend a book or share an article about autism, but",
be careful not to pressure. Most people need to do this on their own terms.,
"Q: Since my son was diagnosed, I’ve felt overwhelmed and I can’t even bring myself",
to read anything about autism.,
Being an advocate for your child with autism will most likely be a lifelong activity. Early on,
"when faced with the diagnosis, parents are easily overwhelmed by the news. They feel",
"confused, fearful and angry. Many tire easily as they try to cope. It is helpful to remember",
"that you are not alone, that others are going through this so there is support available for",
you. Keep a folder of articles and other information material so that when you are able to,
"read it, you will have it available. Pace yourself and in time you will do what needs to be done",
and your efforts over time will make a difference.,

Q: My family’s involvement in church is important to us. How do I get my church to be,
more accepting of my son?,
"For many people, including those members of your church, autism is not something they may",
"have experience with or adequate information about, so you must help educate them. A good",
place to start is with your pastor or minister. See what he or she knows and offer information,
as needed. Sometimes a leader will incorporate the related issues into a sermon or lesson.,
He or she can also suggest folks who can be approached as more open to learning about,
"autism. Then, suggest the church invite a professional to do a workshop on special needs",
"children, with emphasis on the challenges associated with autism. Suggest the church",
develop a plan to accommodate special needs children in their various activities such as the,
"Sunday school classes, the worship service, the choir, etc. At some point, it may be helpful to",
"bring in a behavioral specialist to work with and train the staff. It may mean asking teachers,",
parents and other trained professionals in the church to volunteer time helping out in Sunday,
"school, modifying the lessons, etc. Get your community involved and they will thank you",
later!,
"Once members of your congregation are given accurate information, they will become more",
open and supportive. You may have to suggest ways they can become involved with your,
child and with advocacy organizations. There are so many opportunities for the religious,
"community to get involved and to partner with parents. As advocates, parents have a unique",
opportunity to lead the charge.,
Q: How do I know everything possible is being done for my child? Sometimes it,
seems like not enough progress is being made.,
"Almost daily, every parent with a child with autism asks this question: is there more that can",
"be done to help my child? We work as hard as we can, yet very often we feel as though we",
aren’t doing enough. It is also easy for us to project this on to others involved in our child’s,
"life. In fact, historically, not enough has been done and in many ways, more should be done",
in today’s world. This is what advocacy is all about. We must continue to push for the best,
treatments and services available.,
"Meanwhile, we must recognize that there are some limits that we have to accept.",
"Treatments available today have limits. We are learning so much, but we have a long way",
"to go. Government funding clearly has limits, especially in today’s economy. Teachers are",
frequently overworked with too many students. Sometimes it does help to focus on what is,
"being done and to acknowledge our efforts and the efforts of others. At the same time, as",
"suggested above, parents must be their child’s biggest advocates.",
"When you look at what you do each day, you may want to give yourself a compliment for",
what you have accomplished. Your child is doing the best he or she can given the many,
challenges he or she faces daily. Be kind to yourself and remember that your child with,
"autism, like all children, is going to grow and develop at his or her own pace. While we may",
"want to see our children go from one sentence to five paragraphs in a semester, we must",
accept and celebrate what they do accomplish and gently encourage them forward.,
"Consulting with outside professionals, such as educational therapists, can also help you set",
"goals and look at progress realistically. On this journey, we have to redefine success and",
"progress. It has to be based on our own child’s gifts, and nothing else!",

Q: Is there any financial assistance available to assist in the care and education for our child,
with autism?,
Financial difficulty is one of the biggest stressors that families with special needs children face.,
There seems to never be enough funding or financial help available and each family often finds that,
their own resources are stretched by providing for their child with little hope of reimbursement for all,
that gets spent.,
The primary funding source for your child’s services is mandated through a United States federal,
"law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA governs how states and public",
"agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with",
disabilities.,
"In addition, your family’s medical insurance may reimburse you for autism services, such as speech",
"therapy or behavioral health treatment, such as Applied Behavior Analysis. Start by speaking with",
"the human resources department where you or your spouse work, and inquire about insurance",
reimbursement for autism services. Many states now have government agencies monitoring the,
health insurance industry so this can be a back-up resource to explore benefits as needed.,
Continuing to advocate for increased funding by the government and by the insurance industry is,
"important. For more information about autism insurance reform in your state, visit the Autism Speaks",
website.,
Q: My wife and I worry that over time our other children will develop deep resentments for,
all the attention and “special treatment” their brother gets and this could negatively impact,
their lives. Do you have any suggestions for raising our other children so they don’t feel,
resentment?,
Sibling rivalry occurs in all families with more than one child and it can be especially complex when,
it involves a child with special needs. There is no way to avoid giving some extra attention and,
"treatment to a child with autism. For siblings of children with autism, these feelings may develop",
early because the children may be together all the time.,
"Constantly checking in with your other children about how they are doing, what they need, etc. is",
"a good start. Finding time to be with each child individually also helps immensely, when possible.",
"Involving grandparents, aunts, uncles, trusted neighbors, etc., may help as well.",
Children at various ages have the capacity to understand the special needs of someone else if you,
take the time to explain in terms they will understand. Explain behaviors they see in their brother or,
sister and why you respond differently to deal with these situations. While you don’t want them to,
"become surrogate parents, they do need to know some basic explanations. Also, creating a safe",
space for them to talk about their feelings with you or with others can prevent later development,
of toxic resentments. Helping your other children find successful ways to play or interact with their,
brother or sister is powerful.,
"Siblings may sometimes feel guilty because they do feel resentment and anger, or even just because",
they are “normal” while their brother or sister is not. Guilt and resentment are normal growing up,
"issues, made more complex often because of a special needs sibling. But like any feeling, they can",
be talked about and processed so that your other children move forward in their own emotional,
development and life journeys.,
