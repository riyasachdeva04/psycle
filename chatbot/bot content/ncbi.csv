"Abstract","Although the study of autism is burgeoning with important implications both for public health and society, there is little research exploring the experiences of raising a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the maternal perspective. The aim of this study was to investigate the lived experiences of mothers of children with ASD in Greece. Nine mothers of children with ASD were recruited and engaged in semistructured interviews. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three interconnected themes were identified in the analysis: (a) emotional burden, (b) family burden, and (c) social burden. A key finding in the themes was the sense of burden, distress, and vulnerability experienced by the mothers. The findings provide valuable understanding of the experiences of mothers raising children with ASD in one of Europe’s medium-income countries. Further, results can be used by researchers, clinicians, mental health providers, and policy makers to address the unique needs of families caring for and supporting children with ASD.","","","","","",""
"1. Introduction","ASD is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disability characterized by persistent and pervasive impairments in social understanding and communication, poor adaptive functioning, and the presence of restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests []. Current epidemiological studies have revealed an increased prevalence of ASD over the previous two decades []; ASD has been diagnosed more often in boys than in girls, with a sex ratio of 3 (boys): 1 (girls) []. According to estimates from the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Network, the current prevalence is 1 in every 54 children in the United States [], while in recent years, the prevalence in Europe has increased rapidly, due to an increased awareness of autism and hence an increased likelihood of the condition being diagnosed []. Data suggest that the estimated prevalence of autism diagnosis in Greece approximates 1.15% of school-age children born in 2008 and 2009 (1.83% of males and 0.44% of females) [], which is close to the value for Europe overall [] and internationally [].","Parenting a child with ASD is a stressful and challenging experience [,], particularly in countries where numerous support services are limited. The literature indicates that caregivers of children with ASD often experience impaired mental health, including anxiety and depression [,], a poorer quality of life and wellbeing, and higher levels of stress as compared to caregivers of typically developing children [], and caregivers of children with other childhood disorders such as Down’s syndrome and/or ADHD []. Previous studies revealed that mothers of children with ASD reported elevated psychological distress and caregiving burden [], health-related problems [], lower levels of resilience [] and problems in various areas of family life, including marital and sibling relationships and family socialization []. Fairthorne et al. [] conducted a study in Western Australia from 1983 to 2005, including mothers with live-born children with autism. They found that participants were not only distressed, but also were vulnerable to severe medical conditions such as cancer and had an increased risk of early death. More recently, Gobrial [] conducted a qualitative study of Egyptian mothers of children with ASD. The findings indicated that the diagnosis of autism had a negative effect on the mothers’ social life and mental well-being; caring for a child with autism increased stigmatization of both mothers and their children. In addition, research suggests that financial concerns, such as economic burden and the need for extra income to cover the lifelong high cost of ASD-related special education and treatment, are important factors that contribute to increased parental fatigue, specifically for low-income households [].","Therefore, the current qualitative study considered the lived experiences and challenges of parenting among mothers of children with autism in Greece. This study provides insight into the experiences of mothers caring for children with ASD, but also provides knowledge that can be used to raise public awareness of the unmet maternal psychological needs associated with having a child with ASD and provides empirical information to support researchers and policy makers in developing family focused interventions and education programs for autism in Greece.","","","",""
"2. Materials and Methods","To understand the experiences of mothers of children with ASD, this study employed an exploratory qualitative method. An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to evaluate in-depth interviews, as this approach allows participants to articulate their experiences in great detail and permits better understanding of what a group that shares similar concerns feels and believes about their own worldview [].","","A convenience sample was recruited of nine mothers living in the metropolitan area of Athens whose children aged 5–9 years old had been referred to a child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). All children had received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder according to the DSM-5 criteria [] by a pediatric mental health multidisciplinary team. To be included in the study, mothers were required to speak the Greek language, currently live with their children, and have maternal responsibilities.","The interview protocol was designed to elicit in-depth mothers’ perspectives (i.e., thoughts, feelings, and experiences) through the course of the child’s disability in the present and in the past. Mothers were asked to describe, in their own words, how having and raising a child with autism affected various aspects of their personal, social, and family life, and how this experience affected their needs. The interview started with a very broad question: “Tell me about your experience as a mother raising a child with autism in Greece”; examples of specific questions from the interview protocol include “How has your child’s autism affected your life most?”, “Could you describe your relationship with your child and family members?”, and “Looking forward, what worries do you have about your child’s future?” Given the responses of the participants, extra probes were used to collect additional information and data regarding the themes that the mothers perceived as most relevant. All mothers received the questions in the same order.","2.4. Data Analysis and Validity","IPA was used to analyze the transcripts, to “give voice” to the participants’ essential life viewpoints []. Thus, an in-depth inductive qualitative analysis was conducted to uncover the mothers’ unique perspectives with regard to raising a child with autism, through a detailed examination of their personal perceptions and lived experiences.","To establish the credibility and validity of the results, the interviews were independently coded by the author and two independent PhD-level psychologists; codes were discussed through researcher-supervisor debriefing to enable triangulation, which both enriched the analysis and served as a quality control procedure. Moreover, to further ensure trustworthiness, reflexive discussions were conducted to explore whether the researcher’s previous beliefs about maternal experiences of raising a child with ASD may have influenced his bias, and therefore the results of the analysis."
"3. Results","The analysis revealed three major themes concerning the maternal burden of raising a child with ASD: emotional burden, family burden, and social burden. For each of the superordinate themes, a set of subthemes also emerged (see ).","","The theme of emotional burden was identified by all participants when they were asked about the overall impact of raising a child with autism. Most of the mothers became tearful during interviews when describing their feelings and reported overwhelming emotional reactions to their child’s diagnosis, daily struggles related to the child’s caregiving, and thoughts about the child’s development and future.","Another mother (Anna) reported that “I felt disconnected from myself. I felt always tired and wanting to stay in bed, and I did not control my child’s behavior.” Furthermore, most of the mothers reported a sense of guilt and shame after the diagnosis of ASD, which in turn resulted in their distress and emotional fatigue.","3.3. Social Burden","The second superordinate theme captured by the mothers’ experiences was that autism had caused a change in family life, as the whole familial ecology had to adapt to a new reality; namely that the child needed special parental treatment and long-term care. All of the mothers in this study noticed that after the child’s diagnosis, their relationship with their spouse changed. Most mothers in this sample felt as though they had neglected the needs of their spouse, leading to emotional distance and deterioration compared to previously healthy connections. More specifically, Anna reported:","Only one mother (Eva) reported that hope for relief and positivity in family life developed when her child at times displayed a positive behavior change and improved his adjustment to school."
"4. Discussion","This study used a semistructured interview to explore the mothers’ firsthand accounts of their experiences of raising a child with autism in Greece. IPA analysis resulted in three main themes that described the maternal perspective: emotional burden, family burden, and social burden. The mothers who participated in this study shared information that provided evidence of many emotional, familial, social, and financial challenges associated with raising and supporting a child with ASD.","The first major theme to emerge from this study involved the emotional burden of the child’s diagnosis, feelings of frustration, and worries for the child’s future. In this sample, all mothers were the primary caregiver and perceived their major role as providing and coordinating care for the child in combination with other daily activities, including housekeeping and caring for the other family members’ needs. These numerous caregiving duties negatively impacted maternal mood and well-being, and created feelings of helplessness and powerlessness that increased pessimism regarding the future of their affected child. The current findings support previous studies that found an increased emotional burden associated with raising a child with autism, including increased levels of parenting stress, worry, and guilt among mothers, as well as feelings of being overwhelmed [,]. The mothers’ observations regarding the emotional impact of the child’s diagnosis concur with wider evidence from qualitative studies of parents of children with a range of developmental and mental health disorders who commonly expressed a desire not only to explain the individual experience, but further to search for the answer to an existential question, namely “why did this happen to us?” []. The idea that mothers are readily distressed echoes previous qualitative work, which indicated that parents of children with ASD experience distress and emotional turmoil [] in relation to their child’s potentially dangerous and unpredictable behavior and functional dependency.","Fear of being stigmatized by the autism label and the language used to describe autism led mothers to avoid engaging in social activities, which negatively impacted their social life outside of the immediate family. Therefore, service providers treating and educating the child with autism must understand the value of social support to create opportunities for individuals with autism and their families to overcome social barriers and discrimination []. By providing a continuum of social support services, agencies can enable families to develop in supportive community networks that best meet their unique needs. For example, parent support groups are an effective formal service by which to increase the family’s ability to cope with various stressors [,]. Furthermore, parent groups may be effective at increasing the parents’ acceptance of their child’s disability following discussions with other parents who face similar experiences and concerns. A major disadvantage of these services is that parents need to actively search for them; persons unfamiliar with accessing adequate community resources, such as new immigrants, may not benefit from these community-based services []. From a social perspective, policy-makers need to establish preventive education programs aimed at improving public awareness and fostering people’s deeper understanding of the characteristics and life-long needs of individuals with ASD. Learning to accept neurodivergent people may help to increase positive societal attitudes toward autism and reduce the social stigma associated with autism that impedes the inclusion of individuals with ASD in education and in overall social life [].","","Strengths and Limitations","This study has several strengths. IPA was used to analyze the interview narratives and to describe the significance of these mothers’ current experiences. Consistent with the IPA method, the mothers who participated in the study were selected and interviewed in consistent manner, shortly after the ASD diagnosis of their children. The rationale for this detailed investigation was focused on the centrality of the role played by mothers as caregivers for their sons or daughters and as facilitators of their children’s access to treatment services. Furthermore, the study was carried out in a routine child and adolescent mental health center, thereby providing good ecological validity.","Although this study presents evidence that supports the impact of raising a child with ASD from the maternal perspective, some important limitations must be considered. First, the nature of qualitative research is that it does not seek to be generalizable; therefore, the findings cannot be assumed to apply to other mothers within this population across various contexts []. In addition, recruitment from a wider geographical region may help future studies to sample the diverse motherhood experiences in Greece. However, as the data were collected using a flexible semistructured interview schedule and in-depth analysis was conducted, rich and detailed data were obtained regarding the experiences of these mothers. Second, this study did not reflect the lived experiences of having a child with autism from a paternal perspective. This is particularly important given that the involvement of fathers has been consistently linked with a significant contribution to their children’s positive development []. Therefore, further studies should focus on the role of the father in caring for a child with autism spectrum disorder to gain insight into the fathers’ perspectives on stress and coping resources []. In addition, research integrating full-family conversations may be helpful in assessing common emotions and experiences, as interactions among family members can present often unique and meaningful findings that could contribute to the development of successful family-based interventions. Finally, future research should focus on parental experiences of caring for a family member with autism not only during childhood but also at various other ages, including adolescence and young adulthood."
"5. Conclusions","This study provided useful insights into the mothers’ lived experiences of raising and caring for a child with childhood autism in Greece. The results of the current study revealed that families parenting a child with ASD experience several consequences across many aspects ranging from emotional and family burden to social and financial burden. Mothers reported their children’s behavior and their parenting role as the primary source of their caregiving burden and stress, with intense feelings of autism stigma perceived from their community. Interestingly, these issues had a considerable and broad impact on their own lives. Further research in broader and representative samples including mothers and fathers providing care to children with autism spectrum disorder is needed before these findings can be generalized.","","","","","",""
