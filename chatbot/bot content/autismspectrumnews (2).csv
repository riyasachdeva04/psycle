"– Parents, after receiving an autism diagnosis, experience a plethora of emotions before they accept their child’s diagnosis. Many parents move through emotions like Kubler-Ross’ (1980) stages of grief; grieving for what might have been followed by a plan of action. Having an autistic child may not fit your perspective of what your family should look like, it may feel like you have a square peg to fit into your family circle. You will mourn and that is okay. Give yourself the time and space.","Allow the feelings and emotions"
"– My opinion, all parents of autistic children should receive a merit badge in parenting. Raising an autistic child is like learning a foreign language – but in parenting. It is challenging and sometimes overwhelming. Parents utilize numerous resources to help their child developmentally, but they still worry they are not doing a good enough job. Your child does not need the perfect parent, they need a happy and supportive one. Raising an autistic child is difficult, but it is empowering and will make you a better person.","Realize you are good enough"
"– When you begin learning about autism, there are moments when you will feel lonely and lost. You will learn more from your “support friends and family” than an autism expert. Simply talking to and listening to others who are raising autistic children can be life changing. They get it! It is so comforting to talk with others who get it and support you, especially during times when you feel overwhelmed or isolated. You are not alone in this journey.","Build your support village"
"– Even though your child interprets the world differently, that’s not a bad thing. This is the beginning of an eye-opening journey. Their perspective of the world is amazing; they will show you there are different ways or even better ways to solve problems. Yes, they may have challenges due to their neurodiversity, but they can cope with these challenges with proper support.","Your child’s differences are what make them unique"
"– Your child is not defined by a single diagnosis, they are special in their own way and different in their own way. You will experience parenting challenges but learn to find the joy. Flip your attitude, celebrate the small things and don’t give up hope. Overcoming the challenges and finding that joy is so freeing.","Autism is your child, but it does not define your child"
"– Most developmental milestones are based on normal developing children. Don’t perseverate on age limits and assume that your child will not meet developmental milestones just because they are older. Meet your child where they are developmentally; they will develop on their own timeline. It does not mean they are any better or less than other children; they just got there a little slower. Celebrate the achievements, and don’t give up on them.","Meet your child where they are developmentally"
"– Focusing on the present and unconditional acceptance are vital ingredients for raising a happy child. Perseverating about the future – school, grades, graduation, or future jobs – drains your energy for today. Each day, view your child through a compassionate lens, believing they can achieve anything they put their mind to. Our autistic children can surprise us, developing in ways that seemed impossible when they were younger.","Focusing on the present and unconditional acceptance"
"– Learn about sensory overload. Approximately 80% of autistics exhibit sensory processing issues (Case-Smith, Weaver, & Fristad, 2015). Sensory sensitivity – sounds, sights, tastes, texture are perceived as aversive – is extremely common among autistics and a leading cause to many challenging behaviors (e.g., Cermak, Curtin, & Bandini, 2010; Hillman, 2021).","The environment is loud and overwhelming"
"– If you believe your child is highly capable and intelligent, you will demonstrate that belief through your words and actions. Your child will clearly hear the message, and they will more than likely rise to the expectation. Alternatively, if you focus on the challenging behaviors, believing your child is not capable, unmotivated, or helpless, then your child will hear that message and will perceive themselves as one big flaw. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.","Your belief in your child’s ability influences their achievement"
"– Theodore Roosevelt said, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Every person – you and I included – is a combination of positive traits and plenty of flaws. Choose to see your child’s positive traits rather than focusing on their challenges. When you visit the doctor or therapist, rather than detailing the challenging behaviors and deficits, focus on their strengths. When we trot out an itemized list of our children’s flaws, we are comparing our autistic child to others, and destroying our children’s self-esteem. Identify your child’s strengths then decide how to modify their challenging behaviors using their strengths.","Focus on the positive"
"– Push your child out of their comfort zone, just a little; don’t make it easy for them. Rather than visiting the same park or taking the same route home from school because it is more comfortable for your child, play at different parks or alter your route home by just a few blocks. You are broadening your child’s horizons, but also you are setting higher expectations.","Keep pushing the boundaries"
