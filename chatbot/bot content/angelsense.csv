"Have you ever stopped to consider how your child experiences the world? For children with autism it’s almost as if everything is filtered through a unique lens which heightens even the faintest sounds, smells and tastes. This inundates an autistic child with so much excess data to process and make sense of that they’re often left feeling overwhelmed. For many children with autism, this can make something as simple as concentrating seem like an impossible task.",""
"The autistic brain is truly fascinating. While overwhelm and sensory overload often lead to a lack of focus, there are times when those with autism will be hyperfocused. This is often when something piques a person with autism’s interest and could include things like moving parts of cars, trains, or even a book. One person with autism  how when reading a good book she can become so engrossed she’ll lose track of everything: “When I love a book I read and read and then all of a sudden it’s 4:45am and I have no more book left. Or 8am. Or two days later.”","described"
"Why do children with autism struggle with focus?",""
"What’s interesting and unique about how children with autism focus is that they have an inability to evaluate what’s important and needs to be focused on. Some  which looked at the brain activity of those with autism suggest that when presented with two tasks and told to focus on one of them, most people with autism can’t shift their attention or focus. This is because an inability to understand which task is more important.","studies"
"Another study which explored why  struggle to concentrate, explained that this inability stems not only from a developmental delay, but also whether or not a child is interested enough to focus. This suggests that rather than an impairment, a lack of focus is actually a choice. So it seems all you have to do is give your child something that interests them and you’ll have their undivided, hyperfocused attention. If only it was that simple!","children with autism"
